# Bundle the pinned DragonBreath device firmware INTO the paxx image at build time.
#
# WHY BUNDLE (not fetch at migrate time): the no-USB Panda -> DragonBreath conversion
# must NOT assume the printer or the Panda has an internet connection. The .bin is
# baked into the rootfs here on the CI/build host (which does have internet), and the
# U1 later flashes that local copy to the Panda over the LAN (POST /ota). So the only
# machine that needs internet is the build host, at build time.
#
# SIZE / COMPRESSION: the app image is ~1.08 MB of compiled ESP code. It compresses
# poorly (~0.6 MB) and a compressed bundle would add a decompress step + a new failure
# mode on the U1 at migrate time. Against a ~270 MB image the ~0.4 MB saving isn't
# worth that, so we ship it uncompressed and flash it straight from disk.
#
# The runtime flasher (dragonbreath_migrate.py) reads this exact path as its default
# --image, so keep BUNDLE_DEST in sync with dragonbreath_migrate.DEFAULT_IMAGE.

# Pinned DragonBreath release. Bump alongside the dragonbreath-klipper GIT_SHA pin in
# 01-install-dragonbreath.sh when moving to a new release.
